//(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus division respectively)

let x=3;//let is used to declare varaibles in javascript
let y=16;

//you could also declare the 2 variables using a single let keyword:::::
//let x=4, y=15; :::::uncomment this line and test the code to be sure it's the same as the former

console.log(x/y);
