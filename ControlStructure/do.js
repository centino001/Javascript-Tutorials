//this code is for the do while loop

let i =0;
do{ console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i<5);


// now in this code above; the engine is going to log i at least once, 
//regrdless of the evaluation of the condition(true or false) 
//try changing the value of i to a number greater than 5 and see that it's going to log that number only
//because the condition is false thus the iteration will halt
// try the same this as previous loops and see the results
