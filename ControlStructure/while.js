// this is how a while loop is being written as

let i=0;
while(i<5){
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}


// the difference between while loop and for loop is; i is initialised before starting the loop. while in 
// for loop, i is initialised inside the loop...
//you can do the same thing I did in the for loop here also to test how they all work
