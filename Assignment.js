// hello again:::: here we gonna assign datatypes to variables 
//we are also going to use arithmetic operators to change our assigned variables
// "=" is used to assign things in javascript

let x = 40;
//x has been assigned a value 40 thus anytime you log x in the console,
// instead of showing you x, it'll rather show the value of x "40"

console.log(x);

// // now we want to combine arithmetic operators with the asignment operator

let y=20;
y +=7;//this statement will add 7 to y

// //uncomment the following lines below and run them one after the other to see how they all work
// y *=7;
// y -=7;
// y /=7;
// y %=7;
//y **=7;

console.log(y);

//note that the "++" increment wil not work when using the assigment operator
