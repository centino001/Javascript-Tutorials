//hello again, this file is for logical operators which will return either true or false

let x=1;


//okay as usual, uncomment the line you want to print out on the console and run

//relational 

console.log(x<1);
console.log(x<=1);
console.log(x>1);
console.log(x>=1);

// equality 
console.log(x===1);
console.log(x!==1);
